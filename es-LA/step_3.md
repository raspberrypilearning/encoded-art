## Draw your shapes

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
Set up your shape functions so that you can use them in your encoded artwork.

Decide how many unique **shapes** you would like your artwork to have. The example projects have **three** unique shapes. These are then modified using the parameters of the function. You might like to have more than three, the decision is yours!

Here are some ideas:
+ Three shape functions that load images of either butterflies, snails, or birds
+ Three shape functions that draw squares, circles, and triangles
+ Five shape functions, each one draws a unique animal

**Define** each shape function in preparation for adding in the code that will be needed to draw each shape. Make sure that you define your shape functions **above** your `draw()` function.

---
title: Define your functions
---
You can define your functions in the following way:

--- code ---
---
language: python filename: main.py line_numbers: false line_number_start:
line_highlights:
---
def shape_1():

def shape_2():

def shape_3():

--- /code ---


--- /collapse ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Decide which **parameters** your functions will need. Here are some ideas:
+ A `colour` parameter to allow you to modify the colour of the shapes that you have created
+ A `size` parameter to allow you to adjust the size of the shape or image.
+ An `outline` parameter that adds a different colour to the edge of a drawing

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Add** your chosen **parameters** inside the round brackets of each of your **shape** functions.

--- collapse ---
---
title: Add parameters to your functions
---
You can add parameters to your functions in the following way:

--- code ---
---
language: python filename: main.py line_numbers: false line_number_start:
line_highlights:
---
def shape_1(size, colour):

def shape_2(size, outline):

def shape_3(object, colour):

--- /code ---


--- /collapse ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Add** in the code for each of your shape functions so that the drawing or image will appear when the function is **called**.

Choose: What does your shape look like? Your shape could be:
  - An image provided in the starter project
  - An emoji üéà or text
  - Drawn using a series of geometric shapes


In the [Make a face project](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/make-a-face/0){:target="_blank"}, you learnt how to use a group of geometric shapes to create some fun faces. You can use your skills from that project to help you draw your images.

### Shapes

[[[processing-python-rect]]]

[[[processing-python-triangle]]]

[[[processing-python-quad]]]

[[[processing-translation]]]

[[[processing-rotation]]]

### Colours and effects

Here is some sample code for drawing a square in your encoded art project:

--- code ---
---
language: python filename: main.py - shape_2() line_numbers: false line_number_start:
line_highlights:
---
def shape_2(colour, size):

  fill(colour)   
rect(200, 200, size, size)

--- /code ---

**Notice** that the parameters that are defined in the function above are then used to draw the shape.

--- collapse ---
---
title: Load an image
---

The [Lost in space](https://trinket.io/python/ff931d5dd5){:target="_blank"} example project loads images to create the encoded artwork.

**Remember** that you will need code to display the image:

--- code ---
---
language: python filename: main.py - shape_1()
line_numbers: false
---
def shape_1(size, colour):

  if colour == 'purple': image(purple_planet, 400, 400, size, size) elif colour == 'orange': image(orange_planet, 400, 400, size, size) elif colour == 'green': image(green_planet, 400, 400, size, size) elif colour == 'grey': image(grey_moon, 400, 400, size, size)

--- /code ---

You will also need code to **load** the image in the `setup()` function:

--- code ---
---
language: python filename: main.py - setup()
line_numbers: false
---
def setup():

  # Allow other functions to access the images global purple_planet

  frame_rate(10) size(400, 400)

  # Load the images needed into variables purple_planet = load_image('purple_planet.png') orange_planet = load_image('orange_planet.png') green_planet = load_image('green_planet.png') grey_moon = load_image('moon.png')

--- /code ---

---
title: Use emoji characters
---

You can use emoji characters in the p5 text() function to use an emoji to represent your player.

Here‚Äôs an example:

--- code ---
---
language: python filename: main.py line_numbers: line_number_start:
line_highlights:
---
def setup(): size(400, 400) text_align(CENTER, TOP) #Position around the centre

def draw_emoji(emoji, size): #snake text_size(size) #Controls the size of the emoji text(emoji, 200, 200)

--- /code ---

--- /collapse ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

To **test** that your shape functions work correctly, you will need to **call** them from the `draw()` function. Remember that you can use the `#` to comment out lines of code so that you only see one shape at a time.

Make sure that you add in the arguments for your chosen parameters!

The example below take two or three arguments.

--- code ---
---
language: python filename: main.py line_numbers: false line_number_start:
line_highlights:
---
  shape_1(colour_1, 100) shape_2(colour_2, 100) draw_emoji('üêç', 100)

--- /code ---

**Notice** that the variable names for the chosen `colour` have been placed in the first parameter and some values have been added for the chosen `size` in the second parameter.

--- /task ---

<p style='border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;'>
<span style="color: #0faeb0">Prototyping</span> involves making a draft of what you think your final project might achieve. The focus of prototyping is to make a simplified version of the final product quickly, to allow you to test if it is a workable solution to the problem.
</p>

--- task ---

**Test** your code to see if it displays your chosen images on the screen. At this point, they might all appear on top of each other. You could **call** each function separately to see them more clearly.

**Debug:**

--- collapse ---
---
title: You see an error about arguments
---
+ When you **defined** your function, you decided how many **parameters** it needed. You need to make sure that when you call the function, it has the same number of **arguments**.

--- /collapse ---

--- collapse ---
---
title: Only one shape appears
---
+ Check that you have **called** each shape function.
+ The shapes might be there, but on top of each other. To change this, you could call one function at a time by commenting out the other two function calls with a hashtag `#`.

--- /collapse ---

--- collapse ---
---
title: The drawings are not the right shape/size
---
+ Check that you have entered your **arguments** in the function call in the same order as the **parameters** in the function.
