## Upgrade your project

If you have time you can upgrade your project. 

Here are some ideas you could try:

Enable your project to translate punctuation and numbers by adding dictionary entries for these extra characters.

Here is a version of **Geometric Patterns** that includes most punctuation (but not numbers): [See Inside](https://trinket.io/python/ce34762841)

Add more shapes to your artwork by creating new functions that make new and different objects to go on your canvas.

Give the user some choice over customisation of the artwork by asking them for their favourite colour and using it more often in the drawing.

Give the user the option to redraw the artwork slightly differently, using the same text input. You will need to create an extra input call after drawing, asking if the user is happy with the artwork. If the answer is 'no'; change the `seed` value and redraw, then ask again. Repeat until the answer is 'yes'.

This version of **Kawaii Fruit** uses this technique: [See Inside](https://trinket.io/embed/python/b66a3370ab)
