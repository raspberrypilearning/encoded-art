## Introduction

Create a piece of encoded artwork based on the user's name. Each letter is encoded to a shape that is displayed at random on the screen.

In this project you will:
+ Use a dictionary to encode letters with a variety of shapes
+ Use functions with parameters to add customisation to shapes
+ Create a unique piece of digital art using encoded letters

<span style="color: #0faeb0">**QR codes**</span> are like a little piece of encoded artwork. They are used to represent data, such as website addresses. They are made up of black and white squares that are used to represent letters or numbers. The black and white patterns can be read and decoded by computers.

### Get inspiration

You are going to make some design decisions about the kind of artwork that will be produced when the user enters their name.

Look at these examples. Think about your background and think about whether your design will include shapes, patterns, images or a combination.
