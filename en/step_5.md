**Define** your **dictionary** in the `draw()` function. Make sure that you give it a suitable name and place the dictionary below your colour palette.  

Here is some example code of a dictionary being defined:

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py
line_numbers: false
line_number_start: 
line_highlights: 
---
code = {
    
  }

--- /code ---

**Add** all of the letters of the alphabet as **keys** in the dictionary. Be careful with the syntax that you use. It is very easy to miss out a colon `:` or a comma `,`.
