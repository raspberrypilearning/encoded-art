## Share

If you are in a club, why not **share** your project with friends?

You could also show your family how your project works by sending them a **link**.

To get a link go to the **Share** menu button in the upper-right corner of your Trinket’s edit page and select **Link**.

**Tip:** You can share a link to your project even if you don’t have a Trinket account; however, without an account, the link to your project will change each time you update it. If you have shared the link with someone, you will need to send a new link for them to see the changes.
